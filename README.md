BroadPWN
======

An expoit [originally described here](https://blog.exodusintel.com/2017/07/26/broadpwn/) with this many devices are left vulnerable. However for my purposes I only truely care about a select handfull these include the Nintendo Switch and the iPhone. Although with my iPhone being on 10.1.1 I don't care as much for implementation there as Lucca's Extra-Recipie+Yalu exploit works just fine and I don't care about anything more than that, so my main focus will be with the Nintendo Switch.

##Progress so far

As of this time the exploit currently makes the Nintendo Switch crash upon connecting with error code 2107-0401 and that's all I have to report at this time ;)
